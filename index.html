	<ul>
		<li>Industrial activities: Industrial waste and chemicals can contaminate soil, leading to pollution.</li>
		<li>Agricultural practices: Overuse of pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers can degrade soil quality.
		</li>
		<li>Improper waste disposal: Landfills, dumping grounds, and incineration plants can cause soil pollution
		</li>
		<li>Mining activities: Extracting minerals and other resources can leave behind harmful chemicals and heavy metals
			in the soil.
		</li>
		<li>Urbanization: Construction activities and urban sprawl can disturb the soil, leading to erosion and pollution.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>How We Can Control:</h3>

		alt="How We Can Control pic">

	<ul>
		<li>Implementing sustainable farming practices such as crop rotation, reducing chemical fertilizers and pesticides,
			and adopting organic farming methods.
		</li>
		<li>Proper disposal of hazardous wastes such as industrial chemicals and electronic waste to prevent contamination
			of soil.
		</li>
		<li>Establishing effective waste management systems to reduce the amount of solid waste that ends up in landfills
			and composting organic waste.
		</li>
		<li>Controlling soil erosion through planting vegetation and managing land use to prevent soil from being washed
			away.
		</li>
		<li>Regular testing of soil quality to detect and address soil pollution at an early stage.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Precaution of Soil Pollution:</h3>

		alt="PREACAUTION pic">

	<ul>
		<li>Avoid using pesticides and chemical fertilizers on your soil.
		</li>
		<li>Properly dispose of hazardous waste, such as batteries, oil, and electronics, instead of burying them in the
			soil.
		</li>
		<li>Use organic farming methods, such as crop rotation and composting, to maintain healthy soil.
		</li>
		<li>Prevent soil erosion by planting trees and vegetation and minimizing tillage.
		</li>
		<li>Regularly test your soil to identify any potential pollutants and take appropriate remedial action.
		</li>
	</ul>

		alt="Measures pic">

	<ul>
		<li>Regular testing of soil quality to identify and monitor pollution levels.

		</li>
		<li>Implementation of soil conservation practices to prevent further degradation.

		</li>
		<li>Remediation techniques like phytoremediation, soil washing, and bioremediation to clean contaminated soil.

		</li>
		<li>Strict regulation of hazardous waste disposal to prevent pollution.

		</li>
		<li>Promotion of sustainable agriculture practices that reduce the use of chemicals and promote organic farming</li>
	</ul>
